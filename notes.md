## GENERATORS IN ITERATORS
A generator is a function that can pause execution and resume later.
It returns an iterator object that yields values one by one.

The function* is used to declare/define a generator function.
The yield keyword returns a value to the iterator consumer.
The yield* delegates control onto the other generator.

The power of generators is that it doesn't flatten all at once it yields on demand.
Generators are memory efficient, clean and perfect for big trees and iterations.

## SWITCH-CASE REFRESHER
In a switch-case statement without break, it falls to the next case. That not we want.
The break keyword exits the current switch, for, or while block - but it stays inside the surrounding function.
The return keyword exits the function enterily -- nothing else in the function runs after it.
